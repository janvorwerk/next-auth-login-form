# Simple login page with NextAuth

## What I did

Simply

    npx create-next-app@latest

With some defaults (including the `app router`!)

Then

    yarn add next-auth

... and then hacked a simple (and very insecure ðŸ˜‚) login page.

## To run

To give it a try (with, npm, yarn or...)

    npm install
    npm run dev

Then go to http://localhost:3000 and follow the steps.

* Username is up to you
* Password is `pass`
